# Mashdish managment admin UI

Build on top of Brunch + React + Redux + Babel/ES6 <br/>
This is a modern JS skeleton with React and Redux for [Brunch](http://brunch.io).

## Getting started

* Install (if you don't have them):
    * [Node.js](http://nodejs.org): `brew install node` on OS X
    * [Brunch](http://brunch.io): `npm install -g brunch`
    * Brunch plugins and app dependencies: `npm install`

* Run app, commands to execute in current dir:
    * `npm start` — watches the project with continuous rebuild.
    * `npm run build` — builds minified project for production

* Run 'rails' api, commands to execute in the root of project:
    * `bundle-install` - install the dependencies specified in Gemfile
    * `bin/rails db:migrate` - run the migration
    * `bin/rails server` - start Ruby on Rails built in server

* Open the app
    * Open address `http://localhost:3000/app` in your browser

* Files structure:
    * `mashdish-rails/public/app` dir is fully auto-generated by brunch. Write your code in `mashdish-rails/frontend/app/` dir.
    * Place static files you want to be copied from `mashdish-rails/frontend/app/assets/` to `mashdish-rails/public/app`.
